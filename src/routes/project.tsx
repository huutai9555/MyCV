Therefore, I will describe some features I have implemented using images permitted by the company. This is some features i did during working at company:</p>

                    <p className="text-white">5.Create segment builder page and handle logic for this page. This page is used to filter out customer segments based on the fields that the admin has filtered out. This page splits into two parts. The first tab includes some basic information and the second tab will be used to add fields to filter out the customer segments that the admin needs. </p>
                    <p className="text-white">When you click on add button on the right position on fields. It will be added into the active tab. The field be added will create some information like field name, operator and input. The input will be specified according to the operator and the type of input that has been specified previously. For example, an input of type "date" will be rendered as an input with a date picker, but when the operator is changed, that input will switch to a range picker. As for inputs that require text entry, they may have different validations depending on the type. For instance, phone numbers or emails will have their own specific format validation. The fields can also be left blank or required, depending on the previously selected operator.
                        As for input type "text" but having the data that has been specified previously its ouput is a input with some selection.
                        When all information is valid you can preview it and save it.</p>
